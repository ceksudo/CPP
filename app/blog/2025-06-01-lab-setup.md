C++ is a compile langauge so we will need a compiler to run our c++ code. The major c++ compiler devolopers are clang, gcc and microsoft. This course focuses on latest C++ standard such as C++20 and C++23 and little on C++11 and C++17. Thus we would need the latest compiler that support the implementation of this modern standard. So in order to avoid systems or platform dependent issues will be using a common platform or system via remote cloud linux machine which comes C++ compiler(Clang), build systems (CMake) text editor(Vim) and version control(Git).

<!-- truncate -->

- Also this issues with tooling is the reason why some university uses `CodeBlock` to teach c++ but this hide so many details from students on how c++ is used in the industry. Beside `codeblock` simulate c++ compiler and its doesn't support modern c++ features.

- The essence of this mentorship course is to unveil all real world software engineering practice concerning C++ Ecosystems and how systems softwares are built in the real world.

# Remote Cloud Environmental and Tooling Setup Procedure
## 1. [Register on the Remote Virtalized Machines](https://linuxzoo.net/vm/usercontrol.cgi)
## 2. [Login onto the Remote Virtalized Machines](https://linuxzoo.net/)
- Click on `Join Queue`
- Always select `Kali 2024-4` as the PC of choice under the `control` menu befor you `switch on` and wait for it to finish booting
- Select and click on `JavaScript SSH: SSH` under the `connect` menu to acess the remote PC with the Login Name: `kali` and Passward: `kali`
- [See all shell command line here](https://ss64.com/bash/) and [Get Explaination on shell commands here](https://explainshell.com/)
## 3. Checking for Clang and GCC Compiler
```sh
$ clnag --version
```
```sh
$ gcc --version
```
## 4. Checking for our Text Editor
```sh
$ nano --version
```
```sh
$ vim --version
```
## 5. Create a file `.vimrc` add  Configuration
- copy and past the following in your `.vimrc` file
```sh
" Comments in Vimscript start with a `"`.

" If you open this file in Vim, it'll be syntax highlighted for you.

" Vim is based on Vi. Setting `nocompatible` switches from the default
" Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This
" configuration option turns out not to be necessary for the file named
" '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
" is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
" loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
" `vim -u foo`).
set nocompatible

" Turn on syntax highlighting.
syntax on

" Disable the default Vim startup message.
set shortmess+=I

" Show line numbers.
set number

" This enables relative line numbering mode. With both number and
" relativenumber enabled, the current line shows the true line number, while
" all other lines (above and below) are numbered relative to the current line.
" This is useful because you can tell, at a glance, what count is needed to
" jump up or down to a particular line, by {count}k to go up or {count}j to go
" down.
set relativenumber

" Always show the status line at the bottom, even if you only have one window open.
set laststatus=2

" The backspace key has slightly unintuitive behavior by default. For example,
" by default, you can't backspace before the insertion point set with 'i'.
" This configuration makes backspace behave more reasonably, in that you can
" backspace over anything.
set backspace=indent,eol,start

" By default, Vim doesn't let you hide a buffer (i.e. have a buffer that isn't
" shown in any window) that has unsaved changes. This is to prevent you from "
" forgetting about unsaved changes and then quitting e.g. via `:qa!`. We find
" hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
" for more information on this.
set hidden

" This setting makes search case-insensitive when all characters in the string
" being searched are lowercase. However, the search becomes case-sensitive if
" it contains any capital letters. This makes searching more convenient.
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" Enable searching as you type, rather than waiting till you press enter.
set incsearch

" Unbind some useless/annoying default key bindings.
nmap Q <Nop> " 'Q' in normal mode enters Ex mode. You almost never want this.

" Disable audible bell because it's annoying.
set noerrorbells visualbell t_vb=

" Enable mouse support. You should avoid relying on this too much, but it can
" sometimes be convenient.
set mouse+=a

" Try to prevent bad habits like using the arrow keys for movement. This is
" not the only possible bad habit. For example, holding down the h/j/k/l keys
" for movement, rather than using more efficient movement commands, is also a
" bad habit. The former is enforceable through a .vimrc, while we don't know
" how to prevent the latter.
" Do this in normal mode...
nnoremap <Left>  :echoe "Use h"<CR>
nnoremap <Right> :echoe "Use l"<CR>
nnoremap <Up>    :echoe "Use k"<CR>
nnoremap <Down>  :echoe "Use j"<CR>
" ...and in insert mode
" inoremap <Left>  <ESC>:echoe "Use h"<CR>
" inoremap <Right> <ESC>:echoe "Use l"<CR>
" inoremap <Up>    <ESC>:echoe "Use k"<CR>
" inoremap <Down>  <ESC>:echoe "Use j"<CR>


" ========Automatic Indenting C/C++ programs================

" automatically set the indent 
set cindent shiftwidth=4  

" Setting indent style
set cinoptions+={2

" using a combination of tabs and spaces
set softtabstop=4


" Closing pairs
" inoremap { {}<Esc>ha
" inoremap ( ()<Esc>ha
" inoremap [ []<Esc>ha
" inoremap " ""<Esc>ha
" inoremap ' ''<Esc>ha
" inoremap ` ``<Esc>ha

```
