C++ is a compile langauge so we will need a compiler to run our c++ code. The major c++ compiler devolopers are clang, gcc and microsoft. This course focuses on latest C++ standard such as C++20 and C++23 and little on C++11 and C++17. Thus we would need the latest compiler that support the implementation of this modern standard. So in order to avoid systems or platform dependent issues will be using a common platform or system via remote cloud linux machine which comes C++ compiler(Clang), build systems (CMake) text editor(Vim) and version control(Git).

- Also this issues with tooling is the reason why some university uses `CodeBlock` to teach c++ but this hide so many details from students on how c++ is used in the industry. Beside `codeblock` simulate c++ compiler and its doesn't support modern c++ features.

- The essence of this mentorship course is to unveil all real world software engineering practice concerning C++ Ecosystems.
