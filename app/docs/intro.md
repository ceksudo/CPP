# OSTL10: Principles and Art of Programming with Modern C++

* Hey ChatGPT Tell me about the History of C++ as a reseacher by prompting it few C++ history info.


## The Evolution and History of the C++ Programming Language

**Abstract**

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that has evolved over more than four decades. Originally designed to enhance the C programming language with object-oriented capabilities, C++ has grown into a powerful language that supports multiple programming paradigms. This paper presents a detailed historical overview of the development of C++, including the motivations behind its creation, the role of key individuals and organizations, and the chronological development of its standardized versions, from the inception of “C with Classes” in 1979 to the release of C++20.

**Introduction**

C++ is one of the most widely used and influential programming languages, known for its flexibility, performance, and broad applicability across software domains. Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the late 1970s at Bell Labs, C++ began as a modest attempt to extend the C programming language with features suitable for large-scale software development, particularly object-oriented programming. The language has since undergone numerous revisions and standardizations, making it a modern and robust tool for software engineering.

**Origins: C with Classes (1979–1983)**

The roots of C++ trace back to 1979, when Bjarne Stroustrup sought to develop a language that combined the performance and low-level control of C with the abstraction mechanisms of Simula 67, the first object-oriented programming language. Simula provided powerful modeling tools but was prohibitively slow for practical systems development. To address this, Stroustrup began developing "C with Classes", an extension of C that included:

- Classes

- Basic inheritance

- Inline functions

- Default arguments

- Stronger type checking

The first compiler for this language, Cfront, translated C with Classes into C and was self-hosting, meaning it was written in its own language.

**Transition to C++ (1983–1989)**

In 1983, the language was renamed C++, a nod to the C increment operator, symbolizing an enhanced version of C. Key features introduced during this period included:

- Virtual functions

- Function overloading

- References (&)

- The const qualifier

- Single-line comments (//), borrowed from BCPL

In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was published, providing an authoritative reference in the absence of an official standard. That same year marked C++'s transition to a commercial product.

By 1989, C++ saw the addition of:

- Protected and static class members

- Multiple inheritance

**Pre-Standard Era and the Annotated Manual (1990–1998)**

In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual (ARM) was released, serving as the de facto specification of the language. That same year, Borland’s Turbo C++ was launched, introducing extensive libraries and expanding the language’s reach.

Efforts toward international standardization began in earnest in the early 1990s under the auspices of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21.

**The Standardization Timeline**

1. C++98 (ISO/IEC 14882:1998)

Released in 1998, C++98 marked the first international standard for the language. Influenced heavily by ARM, it formalized features introduced during the 1980s and included the Standard Template Library (STL), which provided generic containers and algorithms.

2. C++03 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003)

C++03 was a minor revision, focused primarily on fixing bugs and inconsistencies in C++98. It did not introduce major new features but solidified the existing specification.

3. C++11 (ISO/IEC 14882:2011)

Initially dubbed C++0x, C++11 introduced a significant number of modern features, many inspired by the Boost libraries. Highlights include:

Auto type deduction

Range-based for loops

Lambda expressions

Rvalue references and move semantics

Variadic templates

Smart pointers (std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr)

Thread and atomic libraries

New standard libraries for time, random numbers, and regular expressions

C++11 represented a paradigm shift, making C++ more expressive and safer while retaining its performance edge.

4. C++14 (ISO/IEC 14882:2014)

C++14 was a relatively small update that improved upon C++11 by adding:

Generic lambdas

Relaxed constexpr restrictions

Binary literals

Return type deduction

It focused on refining the features introduced in C++11 and improving compiler implementability.

5. C++17 (ISO/IEC 14882:2017)

C++17 brought numerous enhancements, including:

if constexpr

Structured bindings

Inline variables

std::optional, std::variant, and std::any

Parallel algorithms

Filesystem library (std::filesystem)

These additions improved the usability and expressive power of the language.

6. C++20 (ISO/IEC 14882:2020)

C++20 is one of the most substantial updates since C++11, introducing long-awaited features such as:

Concepts: for constraining template parameters

Coroutines: for asynchronous programming

Modules: for faster and more modular compilation

Ranges library: enabling range-based functional programming

constexpr enhancements: expanded support for compile-time computation

Calendar and time zones in <chrono>

three-way comparison operator (<=>), known as the "spaceship operator"

C++20 significantly modernized the language, making it more powerful and easier to use in contemporary software systems.

**Future Directions: C++23 and Beyond**

Although outside the historical period discussed here, it is noteworthy that C++23 has already been approved, continuing the trend of regular improvements with features like:

std::expected

Static reflection (under development)

Pattern matching (proposed for C++26)

The C++ standards committee (WG21) remains active, ensuring the language evolves in response to emerging programming paradigms and industry demands.

**Conclusion**

C++ has experienced an extraordinary evolution, transitioning from a C-based language with object-oriented features into a robust, multi-paradigm language capable of supporting modern software development at every scale. Its long-standing emphasis on performance, expressiveness, and backward compatibility makes it unique among programming languages. The standardization process and the contributions of the programming community have been instrumental in shaping what C++ has become today—and what it will continue to be in the future.
